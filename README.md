This project was built based on Karl Hadwen's [Build a Pokemon App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKFoAF7J0mc) on Youtube.

It makes use of Apollo, & GraphQL to call and receive data from the Pokemon API, and uses React to dsiplay and style said data.

After cloning this repo, cd into the pokemon directory and run 

 <npm run start>

This will run the application in development mode on http://localhost:3000
